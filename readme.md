# Modify Image - CSS Variables

In my efforts to improve my skills as a web developer I have joined the JavaScript 30 Challenge/Course. It provides 30 things to build in 30 days. The tasks are designed in vanilla JS, however, as I progress I will find ways to incorportate more advanced technologies like React. [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) can be found by clicking on the name or by clicking [here](https://javascript30.com/).

## Day 3
The third task is a single page with sliders that control the padding size, blue and border color of an image. The sliders update CSS variables using JS.
